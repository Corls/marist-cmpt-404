Corley,

I could not find the .pdf document corresponding to your midterm exam.

Here is your feedback and grade breakdown by problems:

1) There is no explanation about your experiments, except that there are a
bunch of plots that only you and God know what they mean. I wish you could
describe them so would not have to penalize you for not knowing what you did.
-9pts
Did you only run the experiment once? Or the result is the average of multiple
trials? - 1pt

2) It seems like the code works only for initially small values of N. What if I
over-estimate N and start with N=1,000,000? Your code would not work. -1pt
Why is your code not commented? -2pts

3) No picture/drawing.


Peace,
