\noindent Question 1A:\\
See additional pdf. Could not get it to load in here.\\
\\
Question 1B:\\
Using the code, the best CV $E_{out}$ were 0.32521629424094456, 0.21622780944924624, and 0.2162218171729659.\\
The k neighbors of these cards were 1, 285, and 277 respectively.\\
\\
Question 1C:\\
After determining that the best k is 1, I reran the KNeighborRegression function with the all x's and y's\\
and got the $E_{out}$ of 1.0, though it might be worth mentioning that the $E_{out}$ of the true y's, with the x's,\\
resulted in -0.709875352063\\
